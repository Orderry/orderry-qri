Orderry SSE server.
===================
This is only part of our infrastructure for easy integration of push notifications between Server-side and Client-side. Our methods are based on [SSE](http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/#abstract) protocol.

The purpose for creating this library was the need to support data synchronization in cabinets of our customers. Our infrastructure must support synchronization between Server-side frameworks, also including mobile applications, and Client-side SPA.
